## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Cursor editor installation with chat history

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/thomas-pedersen/cursor-chat-browser.git

  ```

3. Start the development server:

  ```

## Configuration

The application automatically detects your Cursor workspace storage location based on your operating system:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage`
- WSL2: `/mnt/c/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`
- Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage`

If automatic detection fails, you can manually set the path in the Configuration page (⚙️).
